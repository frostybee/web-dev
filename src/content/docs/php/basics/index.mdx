## What is PHP?

- **PHP** (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a popular **server-side scripting language** designed for web development.
- It can be embedded within HTML and runs on the server to generate **dynamic web pages** before sending them to users' browsers.

```php
<?php
echo "Hello, World!"; // This runs on the server
?>
<h1>Welcome to my website</h1> <!-- This is HTML -->
```

<?php 
// Variables are simple - just add $
$age = 20;
$name = "Alice";
$isStudent = true;

// Mix PHP with HTML easily
echo "<h1>Hi $name, you are $age years old!</h1>";

// Arrays and loops are straightforward  
$subjects = ["Math", "Science", "History"];
foreach ($subjects as $subject) {
    echo "<li>$subject</li>";
}
?>
```
