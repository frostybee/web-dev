## What is Master-Details?

- Master-Details is a UI pattern that displays a list of items (master) alongside detailed information about a selected item (details). 
- Common examples include email clients, product catalogs, and user management systems, etc.

---

## Common Implementation Patterns

There are several ways to implement the Master-Details pattern, in this example, we will use the separate page approach.

### 1. Single Page Approach
Both master list and details display on the same page:
- Master list always visible.
- Details panel updates based on selection.
- Uses URL parameters for item selection.

### 2. Separate Pages Approach
Master and details on **different pages**:
- Master page shows the list.
- Clicking an item navigates to details page.
- Requires back navigation to return to list.

### 3. AJAX Approach
Dynamic loading without page refresh:
- Master list loads initially.
- Details load via JavaScript/AJAX. 
- Smoother user experience.

## Step 1: Plan Your Database Structure
Design tables with a **clear relationship** between master and detail records:
```sql
-- Master table (e.g., products)
CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    category VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Details can be in the same table or related tables
```

:::note[Key Concepts]
- **Master**: The list view showing summary information
- **Details**: The detailed view of a selected item
- **Selection**: Method to choose which item's details to display
:::

---

## Step 2: Create the Master List
Display all items in a **summary format** with selection links, allow users to click on a product to view the details:

```php
// Fetch all products
$products = fetchAllProducts();

foreach ($products as $product) {
    echo "<a href='?id={$product['id']}'>{$product['name']}</a>";
}
```

---

## Step 3: Handle Item Selection
You can use **URI parameters** or **forms** to identify which item to show details for, in this example, we will use URI parameters:

```php
// Get the selected item ID from the URI (stored in the $_GET superglobal).
$selected_id = $_GET['id'] ?? null;

// Fetch the selected item from the database (using the selected item ID).
if ($selected_id) {
    $selected_item = fetchProductById($selected_id);
}
```
:::note[Key Concepts]
- **URI parameters**: The `id` parameter is appended to the URL to identify the selected item. Or,
- **Forms**: The form submission includes the `id` parameter to identify the selected item.

## Step 4: Display Details Panel
Show comprehensive information about the selected item, in this example, we will display the name and category of the selected item:
```php
if (isset($selected_item)) {
    echo "<h2>{$selected_item['name']}</h2>";
    echo "<p>Category: {$selected_item['category']}</p>";
    // Display additional details (e.g., description, price, etc.).
}
```

---

## Step 5: Implement Navigation (Optional)
Allow users to easily move between items:
```php
// Previous/Next navigation
$prev_id = getPreviousProductId($selected_id);
$next_id = getNextProductId($selected_id);

if ($prev_id) echo "<a href='?id=$prev_id'>Previous</a>";
if ($next_id) echo "<a href='?id=$next_id'>Next</a>";
```

---

## Step 6: Add Search and Filtering
Enable users to filter the master list, in this example, we will allow users to filter the master list by name and category:
```php
// Get the search and category parameters from the URL.
$search = $_GET['search'] ?? '';
$category = $_GET['category'] ?? '';

// Fetch the products from the database (using the search and category parameters).
$products = fetchProducts($search, $category);
```

## Best Practices

### Performance Optimization
- Load only necessary data for the master list.
- Fetch detailed data only when item is selected.
- Implement pagination for large datasets.
- Use database indexing on frequently queried fields.

### User Experience
- Highlight the currently selected item.
- Provide clear navigation between items.
- Show loading indicators for AJAX requests.
- Maintain selection state during filtering.

### Data Management
- Validate item IDs to prevent unauthorized access.
- Handle cases where selected item doesn't exist.
- Implement proper error handling for database queries.
- Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
