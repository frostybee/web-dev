## Slide 1: Introduction to MVC

### Model-View-Controller Pattern

- **Architectural design pattern**
- Separates application logic into **three interconnected** components
- Promotes organized, maintainable code
- Widely used in web development

---

## Slide 2: The Three Components

### Model
- Manages data and business logic
- Handles database interactions
- Contains application rules and validation

### View
- Manages the presentation layer
- Displays data to users
- Handles user interface elements

### Controller
- Acts as intermediary between Model and View
- Processes user input
- Controls application flow

---

## Slide 3: How MVC Works

### The Flow
1. **User interacts** with the View (clicks, forms, etc.)
2. **Controller receives** the user input
3. **Controller processes** the request and interacts with Model
4. **Model performs** business logic and data operations
5. **Model returns** data to Controller
6. **Controller updates** the View with new data
7. **View displays** updated information to user

---

## Slide 4: Benefits of MVC

### Separation of Concerns
- Each component has a specific responsibility
- Easier to maintain and debug
- Changes in one layer don't affect others

### Reusability
- Models can be shared across different views
- Views can display data from multiple models
- Controllers can be reused for similar operations

---

## Slide 5: MVC Benefits (Continued)

### Testability
- Each component can be tested independently
- Mock objects can simulate dependencies
- Unit testing becomes more straightforward

### Team Development
- Different developers can work on different layers
- Frontend and backend development can proceed in parallel
- Clearer code organization

---

## Slide 6: What is Slim Framework?

### Micro-Framework for PHP
- Lightweight and fast
- Minimal setup required
- Perfect for APIs and small web applications
- Follows PSR standards

### Key Features
- Routing system
- Middleware support
- Dependency injection
- HTTP message handling

---

## Slide 7: MVC in Slim Framework

### Slim's Approach
- Provides the foundation for MVC implementation
- Flexible architecture
- Developers implement their own MVC structure
- Uses controllers as route handlers

### Components in Slim
- **Routes** define application endpoints
- **Middleware** handles cross-cutting concerns
- **Containers** manage dependencies
- **Templates** render views

---

## Slide 8: Model Layer in Practice

### Responsibilities
- Database connections and queries
- Data validation and sanitization
- Business rules enforcement
- Entity relationships

### Best Practices
- Keep models focused on single responsibility
- Use proper validation
- Handle errors gracefully
- Implement proper database abstraction

---

## Slide 9: View Layer in Practice

### Responsibilities
- Template rendering
- HTML/JSON output generation
- User interface components
- Data presentation formatting

### Best Practices
- Keep views simple and logic-free
- Use template engines (Twig, Smarty)
- Separate presentation from business logic
- Ensure responsive design

---

## Slide 10: Controller Layer in Practice

### Responsibilities
- Handle HTTP requests
- Coordinate between Model and View
- Process user input
- Manage application flow

### Best Practices
- Keep controllers thin
- Delegate business logic to models
- Handle one responsibility per action
- Proper error handling and validation

---

## Slide 11: Common MVC Patterns

### Fat Model, Thin Controller
- Business logic lives in models
- Controllers only coordinate
- Easier testing and maintenance

### Service Layer
- Additional layer between Controller and Model
- Handles complex business operations
- Promotes code reuse

---

## Slide 12: MVC Best Practices

### General Guidelines
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Use dependency injection
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow naming conventions
- Write comprehensive tests

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of data
- Efficient database queries
- Proper caching strategies
- Minimize controller complexity
