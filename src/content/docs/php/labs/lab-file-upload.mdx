## Lab Instructions: Implementing File Upload

In this lab, you will implement secure file upload functionality for your Slim 4 application. File uploads are a common requirement in web applications, allowing users to share images, documents, and other files. By the end of this lab, you'll have a fully functional and secure file upload system with proper validation and error handling.

### How File Uploads Work

When a user uploads a file through an HTML form, the file data is sent to the server as part of an HTTP POST request with a special encoding type (`multipart/form-data`). The server receives this data and temporarily stores it in a system directory. Your PHP application then processes this temporary file and moves it to a permanent location on disk.

Slim Framework makes this process straightforward by providing access to uploaded files through its PSR-7 Request object. Instead of working directly with PHP's `$_FILES` superglobal, Slim wraps uploaded files in `UploadedFileInterface` objects, which provide a clean, object-oriented API for handling file uploads.

In this lab, you'll learn how to create an upload form, receive files on the server, validate them for security, and save them safely to your server's filesystem using best practices.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this lab, you will:
- Understand how file uploads work in PHP and Slim 4.
- Create a reusable `FileUploadHelper` class for handling file uploads.
- Build an `UploadController` that extends `BaseController`.
- Use BaseController methods (`render()` and `redirect()`) for clean code.
- Handle uploaded files using Slim's PSR-7 request object.
- Implement file validation (type, size, MIME type) with proper error handling.
- Apply the Result pattern for success/failure communication.
- Securely store uploaded files with unique filenames.
- Display uploaded files to users.
- Apply security best practices to prevent malicious file uploads.
- Demonstrate proper separation of concerns (MVC pattern).

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, ensure you have:
- A working Slim 4 application with the BaseController pattern.
- Completed the Flash Messages lab (for user feedback).
- Completed the Result Pattern assignment (for error handling).
- SessionMiddleware registered for flash messages.
- Bootstrap CSS included in your views (for styled forms and alerts).
- A `public/` directory for serving uploaded files.
- Your development environment set up and running.

---

## Lab Steps

### Step 1: Create the Uploads Directory

**Objective:** Set up a directory structure for storing uploaded files.

**Instructions:**

1. Navigate to your project's `public/` directory
2. Create a new folder named `uploads/`
3. Inside `uploads/`, create a subfolder named `images/`
4. Verify the directory structure:
   ```
   public/
   └── uploads/
       └── images/
   ```

5. **Permissions Note:**
   - **On Windows:** No action needed. PHP will automatically have write access if you created the directory.
   - **On Linux/Mac:** Ensure the web server has write permissions: `chmod 755 public/uploads/`

**What you just created:**
- A dedicated directory for uploaded files within the public folder.
- A subdirectory for organizing image uploads.
- A location accessible via URL for serving uploaded files.

---

### Step 2: Create the FileUploadHelper Class (Server-Side)

**Objective:** Create a reusable helper class to handle file upload logic with proper validation and error handling.

**Why create a helper class?**

Separating file upload logic into a helper class provides several benefits:
- **Reusability**: Use the same upload logic across multiple routes and controllers.
- **Clean controllers**: Keep route handlers focused on HTTP concerns (request/response).
- **Testability**: Easily unit test upload logic in isolation.
- **Maintainability**: One place to fix bugs or add features.
- **Best practices**: Demonstrates proper separation of concerns and the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

**Instructions:**

1. Navigate to your `app/Helpers/` directory.
2. Create a new file named `FileUploadHelper.php`.  
3. Add the following code:

```php title="app/Helpers/FileUploadHelper.php"
<?php

namespace App\Helpers;

use Psr\Http\Message\UploadedFileInterface;

class FileUploadHelper
{
    /**
     * Upload a file with validation and return a Result.
     *
     * @param UploadedFileInterface $uploadedFile The uploaded file from the request
     * @param array $config Configuration options:
     *   - 'directory' (string): Upload directory path (required)
     *   - 'allowedTypes' (array): Array of allowed MIME types (required)
     *   - 'maxSize' (int): Maximum file size in bytes (required)
     *   - 'filenamePrefix' (string): Prefix for generated filenames (default: 'upload_')
     * @return Result Success with filename, or failure with error message
     */
    public static function upload(UploadedFileInterface $uploadedFile, array $config): Result
    {
        // Extract configuration with defaults.
        $directory = $config['directory'] ?? null;
        $allowedTypes = $config['allowedTypes'] ?? [];
        $maxSize = $config['maxSize'] ?? 0;
        $filenamePrefix = $config['filenamePrefix'] ?? 'upload_';

        // Validate configuration.  
        if (!$directory) {
            return Result::failure('Upload directory not specified in configuration');
        }

        if (empty($allowedTypes)) {
            return Result::failure('Allowed file types not specified in configuration');
        }

        if ($maxSize <= 0) {
            return Result::failure('Maximum file size not specified in configuration');
        }

        // Validate upload success.
        if ($uploadedFile->getError() !== UPLOAD_ERR_OK) {
            return Result::failure('Error uploading file');
        }

        // Validate file size.
        if ($uploadedFile->getSize() > $maxSize) {
            $maxSizeMB = round($maxSize / (1024 * 1024), 1);
            return Result::failure("File too large (max {$maxSizeMB}MB)");
        }

        // Validate file type.
        $clientMediaType = $uploadedFile->getClientMediaType();
        if (!in_array($clientMediaType, $allowedTypes)) {
            return Result::failure('Invalid file type. Only ' . implode(', ', $allowedTypes) . ' allowed.');
        }

        // Generate safe filename.
        $extension = pathinfo($uploadedFile->getClientFilename(), PATHINFO_EXTENSION);
        $filename = uniqid($filenamePrefix) . '.' . $extension;

        // Create directory if it doesn't exist.
        if (!is_dir($directory)) {
            // Note: 0755 permissions work on Unix/Linux/Mac, ignored on Windows
            if (!mkdir($directory, 0755, true)) {
                return Result::failure('Failed to create upload directory');
            }
        }

        // Build full file path.
        $destination = $directory . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . $filename;

        // Move uploaded file to permanent location.
        try {
            $uploadedFile->moveTo($destination);
        } catch (\Exception $e) {
            return Result::failure('Failed to save uploaded file: ' . $e->getMessage());
        }

        // Return success with filename.
        return Result::success('File uploaded successfully', ['filename' => $filename]);
    }
}
```

4. Save the file.

**What you just created:**
- A static helper method that encapsulates all file upload logic
- Configuration-driven approach for flexibility
- Complete validation (errors, size, type)
- Automatic directory creation if needed
- Secure filename generation using `uniqid()`
- Result pattern for clean success/failure handling
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Reusable across your entire application

---

### Step 3: Create the HTML Upload Form (Client-Side)

**Objective:** Create an HTML form that allows users to select and upload files.

**Key Points About the Form:**

Before creating the form, understand these essential attributes:

- **`method="POST"`:** File uploads require POST requests because file data cannot be sent via GET. GET requests only support URL parameters, which are limited in size and format.

- **`enctype="multipart/form-data"`:** This is the most critical attribute! It tells the browser to encode the form data as multiple parts (one for each form field, including files). Without this attribute, the browser will send only the filename as text, not the actual file content.

- **`<input type="file">`:** This creates the file selection button. The `name` attribute is important - you'll use this name to access the uploaded file in your PHP code.

**Instructions:**

1. Navigate to your `views/` directory.
2. Create a new folder named `upload/`
3. Inside `upload/`, create a file named `uploadView.php`.
4. Add the following HTML code:

```html title="views/upload/uploadView.php"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>File Upload Demo</title>
    <!-- Bootstrap 5 CSS -->
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container mt-5">
        <h1 class="mb-4">File Upload Demo</h1>

        <!-- Flash Messages Display Area -->
        <div class="mb-4">
            <?= App\Helpers\FlashMessage::render() ?>
        </div>

        <!-- Upload Form -->
        <div class="card mb-4">
            <div class="card-header">
                <h5>Upload an Image</h5>
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <form method="POST" action="/upload" enctype="multipart/form-data">
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <label for="myfile" class="form-label">Choose a file:</label>
                        <input
                            type="file"
                            class="form-control"
                            id="myfile"
                            name="myfile"
                            accept="image/*"
                            required>
                        <div class="form-text">
                            Select an image file to upload (JPEG, PNG, GIF).
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Upload File</button>
                </form>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Bootstrap 5 JS -->
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

5. Save the file

**What you just created:**
- An HTML form with `method="POST"` for file uploads
- The critical `enctype="multipart/form-data"` attribute
- A file input field with `name="myfile"` (you'll use this name in PHP)
- Bootstrap styling for a clean interface
- Flash message display area for feedback

---

### Step 4: Create the UploadController (Server-Side)

**Objective:** Create a controller class to handle file upload requests using the BaseController pattern.

**Why use a controller?**

Using a controller class (instead of closures in routes) provides:
- Access to BaseController helper methods (`render()`, `redirect()`).
- Better code organization.
- Easier testing and maintenance.
- Consistent with the MVC pattern.

**Instructions:**

1. Navigate to your `app/Controllers/` directory.
2. Create a new file named `UploadController.php`.
3. Add the following code:

```php title="app/Controllers/UploadController.php"
<?php

namespace App\Controllers;

use App\Helpers\FileUploadHelper;
use App\Helpers\FlashMessage;
use DI\Container;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface as Response;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Request;

class UploadController extends BaseController
{
    public function __construct(Container $container)
    {
        parent::__construct($container);
    }

    /**
     * Display the upload form.
     */
    public function index(Request $request, Response $response, array $args): Response
    {
        $data = [
            'title' => 'File Upload Demo'
        ];

        return $this->render($response, 'upload/uploadView.php', $data);
    }

    /**
     * Process file upload.
     */
    public function upload(Request $request, Response $response, array $args): Response
    {
        // Get the uploaded file from the request.
        $uploadedFiles = $request->getUploadedFiles();
        $uploadedFile = $uploadedFiles['myfile'];

        // Configure upload settings.
        $config = [
            'directory' => __DIR__ . '/../../public/uploads/images',
            'allowedTypes' => ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif'],
            'maxSize' => 2 * 1024 * 1024, // 2MB in bytes
            'filenamePrefix' => 'upload_'
        ];

        // Use the helper to handle the upload.
        $result = FileUploadHelper::upload($uploadedFile, $config);

        // Handle the result.       
        if ($result->isSuccess()) {
            // Get the filename from the result data.
            $filename = $result->getData()['filename'];

            // Store filename in session for display.
            if (!isset($_SESSION['uploaded_files'])) {
                $_SESSION['uploaded_files'] = [];
            }
            $_SESSION['uploaded_files'][] = $filename;

            // Show success message.
            FlashMessage::success($result->getMessage() . ": {$filename}");
        } else {
            // Show error message.   
            FlashMessage::error($result->getMessage());
        }

        // Redirect back to the upload form using BaseController method.
        return $this->redirect($request, $response, 'upload.index');
    }
}
```

4. Save the file.

**What you just created:**
- An `UploadController` that extends `BaseController`.
- An `index()` method that uses `$this->render()` to display the form.
- An `upload()` method that processes uploads and uses `$this->redirect()`.
- Clean separation: controller handles HTTP, helper handles file logic.
- Proper use of BaseController helper methods.

---

### Step 5: Register the Routes

**Objective:** Register routes that map URLs to the UploadController methods.

**Instructions:**

1. Open your `app/Routes/web-routes.php` file.
2. Add the import at the top:

```php
use App\Controllers\UploadController;
```

3. Add the following routes:

```php
// File upload routes
$app->get('/upload', [UploadController::class, 'index'])->setName('upload.index');
$app->post('/upload', [UploadController::class, 'upload'])->setName('upload.process');
```

4. Save the file.
5. Test by visiting `/upload` in your browser - you should see the upload form

**What you just created:**
- A GET route that calls `UploadController::index()` to display the form
- A POST route that calls `UploadController::upload()` to process uploads
- Named routes for easy use with `redirect()` method

---

### Step 6: Display Uploaded Files (Optional Enhancement)

**Objective:** Update the view to show a gallery of uploaded files.

**Instructions:**

1. Open `views/upload/uploadView.php`
2. Add the following code after the upload form (before the closing `</div>` tag):

```php
<!-- Uploaded Files Display -->
<?php if (!empty($_SESSION['uploaded_files'])): ?>
<div class="card mt-4">
    <div class="card-header">
        <h5>Uploaded Files</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
        <div class="row">
            <?php foreach (array_reverse($_SESSION['uploaded_files']) as $filename): ?>
            <div class="col-md-4 mb-3">
                <div class="card">
                    <img
                        src="/uploads/images/<?= htmlspecialchars($filename) ?>"
                        class="card-img-top"
                        alt="Uploaded image"
                        style="height: 200px; object-fit: cover;">
                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p class="card-text small text-muted">
                            <?= htmlspecialchars($filename) ?>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <?php endforeach; ?>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<?php endif; ?>
```

3. Save the file

**What you just added:**
- Check if uploaded files exist in session
- Display files in a responsive grid layout
- Show each image with its filename
- Most recent uploads appear first

---

### Step 7: Test Your Implementation

**Objective:** Verify that file uploads work correctly and securely.

**Instructions:**

1. Start your development server (if not already running)
2. Visit `http://localhost/[your-app-name]/upload` in your browser
3. Test the following scenarios:

**Test Case 1: Valid Image Upload**
- Click "Choose File" and select a valid image (JPEG, PNG, or GIF)
- Click "Upload File"
- Expected: Green success message and image appears below

**Test Case 2: Invalid File Type**
- Try to upload a .txt or .pdf file
- Expected: Red error message about invalid file type

**Test Case 3: Large File**
- Try to upload an image larger than 2MB
- Expected: Red error message "File too large (max 2MB)"

**Test Case 4: Invalid File Type**
- Try to upload a .txt, .pdf, or .exe file
- Expected: Red error message about invalid file type

**Test Case 5: Multiple Uploads**
- Upload several different images
- Expected: All images appear in the gallery below
- Each file should have a unique filename like `upload_673abc123def.jpg`

**Expected Behavior:**

- ✅ Valid images upload successfully
- ✅ Success messages appear for successful uploads
- ✅ Error messages appear for invalid uploads
- ✅ Uploaded files appear in the `public/uploads/images/` directory
- ✅ Images display correctly in the gallery (if you added Step 8)
- ✅ Invalid file types are rejected
- ✅ Files larger than 2MB are rejected
- ✅ Each uploaded file has a unique filename with `upload_` prefix

**If uploads don't work:**
- Check that `public/uploads/images/` directory exists
- Verify write permissions on the uploads directory (0755)
- Check `upload_max_filesize` in php.ini (should be at least 2MB)
- Check `post_max_size` in php.ini (should be larger than upload_max_filesize)
- Ensure the form has `enctype="multipart/form-data"`
- Check browser console and PHP error logs
- Verify SessionMiddleware is registered for flash messages
- Make sure FlashMessage helper is available

## Understanding What You Built

### FileUploadHelper API

The `FileUploadHelper` class provides a simple, static API for handling file uploads:

```php
FileUploadHelper::upload(UploadedFileInterface $uploadedFile, array $config): Result
```

**Configuration Options:**

| Option | Type | Required | Description | Example |
|--------|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `directory` | string | Yes | Upload directory path | `__DIR__ . '/public/uploads/images'` |
| `allowedTypes` | array | Yes | Allowed MIME types | `['image/jpeg', 'image/png']` |
| `maxSize` | int | Yes | Max size in bytes | `2 * 1024 * 1024` (2MB) |
| `filenamePrefix` | string | No | Filename prefix | `'upload_'` (default) |

**Return Value:**

Returns a `Result` object that either:
- **Success**: Contains `['filename' => 'upload_abc123.jpg']` in data
- **Failure**: Contains error message describing what went wrong

**Example Usage:**

```php
$result = FileUploadHelper::upload($uploadedFile, [
    'directory' => __DIR__ . '/uploads',
    'allowedTypes' => ['image/jpeg', 'image/png'],
    'maxSize' => 2 * 1024 * 1024,
    'filenamePrefix' => 'avatar_'
]);

if ($result->isSuccess()) {
    $filename = $result->getData()['filename'];
    echo "Uploaded: {$filename}";
} else {
    echo "Error: " . $result->getMessage();
}
```

### How File Upload Works (With Helper Pattern)

1. **Form Submission:** User selects file and submits form with `enctype="multipart/form-data"`
2. **File Reception:** PHP receives file in `$_FILES` superglobal, Slim wraps it in PSR-7 UploadedFileInterface
3. **Route Mapping:** Slim routes the POST request to `UploadController::upload()`
4. **Controller Handling:** Controller retrieves the file using `$request->getUploadedFiles()`
5. **Helper Call:** Controller calls `FileUploadHelper::upload()` with file and configuration
6. **Helper Validation:** Helper validates upload errors, MIME type, and file size
7. **Unique Naming:** Helper generates unique filename using `uniqid()`
8. **Storage:** Helper moves file to permanent location using `moveTo()`
9. **Result Return:** Helper returns Result object (success with filename, or failure with error)
10. **Controller Response:** Controller checks result, sets flash message, stores filename in session
11. **Redirect:** Controller uses `$this->redirect()` to send user back to upload form (PRG pattern)

### Architecture: Separation of Concerns

| Component | Responsibility | Location |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| **View** | Display form and images | `views/upload/uploadView.php` |
| **Controller** | Handle HTTP request/response | `app/Controllers/UploadController.php` |
| **Route** | Map URLs to controller methods | `app/Routes/web-routes.php` |
| **Helper** | Validate and save files | `app/Helpers/FileUploadHelper.php` |
| **Result** | Communicate success/failure | `Result` class |
| **Flash** | Display user feedback | `FlashMessage` helper |

### Security Layers Implemented

| Security Layer | Purpose | Implementation |
|----------------|---------|----------------|
| Error Check | Ensure upload succeeded | `getError() !== UPLOAD_ERR_OK` |
| Size Validation | Prevent large file attacks | `getSize() > maxSize` check |
| MIME Type Check | Verify file type from browser | `getClientMediaType()` + whitelist |
| Unique Filenames | Prevent path traversal & overwrites | `uniqid('upload_')` |
| Directory Isolation | Store files in safe location | `public/uploads/images/` |

### Benefits of the Helper Pattern

**Code Reusability:**
```php
// Use the same helper for profile pictures
$result = FileUploadHelper::upload($file, [
    'directory' => __DIR__ . '/uploads/avatars',
    'allowedTypes' => ['image/jpeg', 'image/png'],
    'maxSize' => 1 * 1024 * 1024,
    'filenamePrefix' => 'avatar_'
]);

// Use it for document uploads
$result = FileUploadHelper::upload($file, [
    'directory' => __DIR__ . '/uploads/docs',
    'allowedTypes' => ['application/pdf'],
    'maxSize' => 5 * 1024 * 1024,
    'filenamePrefix' => 'doc_'
]);
```

**Clean Controller Methods:**
- Controllers stay focused on HTTP concerns
- No validation logic mixed with controller logic
- Easy to read and maintain
- Consistent error handling across all upload operations
- Proper use of BaseController helper methods (`render()`, `redirect()`)

**Testability:**
- Test helper independently of HTTP layer
- Mock UploadedFileInterface for unit tests
- Test configuration handling
- Verify Result objects are returned correctly

### PHP File Upload Error Codes

| Error Code | Constant | Meaning |
|------------|----------|---------|
| 0 | `UPLOAD_ERR_OK` | Upload successful |
| 1 | `UPLOAD_ERR_INI_SIZE` | Exceeds `upload_max_filesize` |
| 2 | `UPLOAD_ERR_FORM_SIZE` | Exceeds `MAX_FILE_SIZE` in form |
| 3 | `UPLOAD_ERR_PARTIAL` | File partially uploaded |
| 4 | `UPLOAD_ERR_NO_FILE` | No file uploaded |
| 6 | `UPLOAD_ERR_NO_TMP_DIR` | Missing temp directory |
| 7 | `UPLOAD_ERR_CANT_WRITE` | Failed to write to disk |
| 8 | `UPLOAD_ERR_EXTENSION` | PHP extension stopped upload |

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "No file was uploaded" Error

**Cause:** Form missing `enctype="multipart/form-data"` attribute

**Solution:**
- Ensure form tag has: `<form method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">`
- This attribute is REQUIRED for file uploads

### Issue 2: File Size Limit Exceeded

**Cause:** PHP configuration limits are too low

**Solution:**
- Edit `php.ini` and increase:
  ```ini
  upload_max_filesize = 10M
  post_max_size = 12M
  ```
- Restart your web server after changes

### Issue 3: Permission Denied Errors

**Cause:** Web server doesn't have write permissions

**Solution:**

**On Windows:**
- Usually not an issue for local development - if you created the folder, PHP should have access
- If you see permission errors, right-click folder → Properties → Security → Edit permissions
- Ensure "Users" group has "Modify" permissions

**On Linux/Mac:**
- Run: `chmod 755 public/uploads/`
- Or: `chmod 777 public/uploads/` (less secure, but works for development)
- Ensure the directory is owned by the web server user (e.g., `www-data`, `apache`)

**Note:** The `0755` parameter in `mkdir()` is automatically ignored on Windows, so you don't need to change the code

### Issue 4: Files Not Appearing in Gallery

**Cause:** Uploaded files not tracked in session

**Solution:**
- Verify you're storing filenames in `$_SESSION['uploaded_files']`
- Check that SessionMiddleware is registered
- Ensure session_start() is called

### Issue 5: Images Not Displaying (Broken Images)

**Cause:** Incorrect file path in `src` attribute

**Solution:**
- Verify image src uses: `/uploads/images/filename.jpg`
- Check that files exist in `public/uploads/images/`
- Open browser dev tools to see 404 errors

### Issue 6: Security Warning - File Type Bypass

**Cause:** Relying only on client-side validation

**Solution:**
- ALWAYS validate on server-side in your POST route
- Check file errors, size, and MIME type
- Never trust client-provided MIME types alone
- Consider adding `getimagesize()` check for extra security

## Test Your Understanding

:::note[Answer the questions below]
1. Why is `enctype="multipart/form-data"` required in the form tag for file uploads?
2. Why do we validate MIME type in addition to checking the file extension?
3. What is the purpose of generating unique filenames instead of using the original filename?
4. What security risks exist if you trust user-provided filenames?
5. Why should uploaded files be stored in the `public/` directory for this lab?
6. What PHP configuration settings limit the maximum upload size, and which one should be larger?
7. How does using `uniqid()` protect against path traversal attacks?
8. Why is it important to use the Post-Redirect-Get pattern after file upload?
9. What does `UPLOAD_ERR_OK` indicate, and why do we check for it?
10. What would happen if you didn't call `moveTo()` on the uploaded file?
