## What is Admin Panel?

**Admin Panel** is a special, protected area of your website that **only administrators** can access. Think of it like the "backstage" of your e-commerce site, where admins can manage products, orders, categories, and other important website content.

## Why Do We Need It?

In a real e-commerce application, you don't want regular users to be able to add or delete products, or view all orders. That's why we create an admin panel:
- **Protect sensitive data:**  Only admins can access it.
- **Manage content:**  Admins can add, update, or remove products and categories.
- **Monitor orders:**  Admins can view and manage customer orders.  
- **Control the site:**  Admins have special permissions regular users don't have.

:::note
This guide walks you step-by-step through building an admin panel for your Slim MVC application. By the end, you'll have a secure, protected area where administrators can manage your entire e-commerce system.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Create Admin Authentication Middleware

**What is Middleware?** Middleware acts like a "security guard" for your admin routes. Before any admin page loads, the middleware checks: "Is this user logged in? Are they an admin?" If not, it redirects them away.

**What Your Middleware Should Do:**
- Check if the user is logged in (authenticated).
- Check if the user has admin privileges (is an admin).
- If both conditions are met → allow access to the admin page.
- If either check fails → redirect to the login page.

**Think of it like this:** Middleware runs BEFORE your controller's request handler (callback method), acting as a gatekeeper. A middleware is a reusable component, so you don't have to write the same security checks in every admin controller.

---

## 2. Create a Set of Controllers

A set of controller classes is required to be created to handle the "business logic" for your admin pages. Each controller class should manage a specific part of your admin panel.

**Common Admin Controllers:**
- **AdminController** or **DashboardController**:  Shows an overview/stats (total products, orders, users, etc.).
- **ProductsController**:  Handles listing, creating, editing, and deleting products.
- **CategoriesController**:  Manages product categories.
- **OrdersController**:  Views and manages customer orders.  
- **UsersController**:  Manages user accounts and permissions.

**Each controller should have methods like:**
- `index()` → Display a list of items.
- `show()` → Show details of a single item.
- `create()` → Display a form to create a new item.
- `store()` → Save a new item to the database.
- `edit()` → Display a form to edit an item.
- `update()` → Save changes to an item.
- `delete()` → Remove an item.

All the logic for handling admin requests goes in these controllers.

## 3. Set Up an Admin Routes Group

**What is a Route Group?** A route group lets you organize **related routes** and apply the one ore middleware to all of them at once. It's like grouping all your admin routes under one "umbrella" and saying "all these routes are protected."

**Why Group Admin Routes?**
- All admin routes share the same prefix (`/admin`).
- All admin routes need the same security check (AdminAuthMiddleware).
- It keeps your code organized and **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself).

#### Routing Group Example

```php
$app->group('/admin', function ($group) {
    // Dashboard route
    $group->get('/dashboard', [AdminController::class, 'dashboard']);

    // User management routes
    $group->get('/users', [AdminController::class, 'users']);

    // Product management routes
    $group->get('/products', [ProductsController::class, 'index']);
    $group->post('/products/create', [ProductsController::class, 'createProduct']);

    // Category management routes
    $group->get('/categories', [CategoriesController::class, 'index']);
    $group->post('/categories/create', [CategoriesController::class, 'create']);

    // TODO: Add here the remaining routes for orders, product editing, category editing, etc.
})->add(AdminAuthMiddleware::class);  // Apply middleware to ALL routes in this group
```

**How This Works:**
1. All routes inside the group automatically start with `/admin`
2. The middleware at the end (`.add(AdminAuthMiddleware::class)`) applies to every route in the group
3. When someone tries to visit `/admin/products`, the middleware runs first to check if they're an admin

**Routes Created:**
- `/admin/dashboard` → Admin dashboard
- `/admin/users` → User management
- `/admin/products` → Product listing
- `/admin/products/create` → Create new product (POST request)
- `/admin/categories` → Category listing
- `/admin/categories/create` → Create new category (POST request)

---

## 4. Create Admin Views

**What Are Views?** Views are the HTML/UI that users see. They display the data from your controllers and provide forms for admins to interact with (add products, edit categories, etc.).

**Views You'll Need:**
- **Dashboard View** → Shows statistics and overview of your e-commerce site.
- **Products Views** → List products, show details, create/edit product forms.   
- **Categories Views** → Manage categories with forms to add/edit.
- **Orders Views** → Display and manage customer orders.
- **Users Views** → Manage user accounts and admin privileges.

**Tips for Admin Views:**
- Keep them consistent with clean, professional styling (e.g., using Bootstrap, Bluma, Tailwind CSS, etc.).
- Make forms clear and easy to use.
- Add confirmation dialogs for delete actions.
- Show success/error messages to users.
- Include navigation menu to switch between different admin sections.

## Expected File Structure

After implementing the admin panel following the steps above, your project should be organized like this:

:::tip
This structure follows the **MVC pattern** (Model-View-Controller). This keeps your code organized and makes it easier to maintain and scale your application.
